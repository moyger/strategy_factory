## 🚀 Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Paper Trading (4 weeks) ✅ **START NOW**
- **Capital:** $0 (paper trading)
- **Goal:** Verify execution logic
- **Checklist:**
  - ✅ Quarterly rebalancing works
  - ✅ GLD switching logic correct
  - ✅ No execution errors
  - ✅ Orders execute at expected prices

### Phase 2: Small Capital (12 weeks / 1 quarter)
- **Capital:** 10-20% of intended ($10K-$20K if planning $100K)
- **Goal:** Validate real-world performance
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Quarterly return within ±10% of expectation
  - Slippage <0.5% per trade
  - No operational issues

### Phase 3: Full Deployment
- **Capital:** 100% of intended allocation
- **Goal:** Scale to full capital
- **Timing:** After successful Phase 2 completion

## ⚠️ Risk Factors

### 1. **Higher Drawdown Risk**
- Max drawdown -38.5% (vs target -25%)
- Requires strong stomach during corrections
- **Mitigation:** GLD protection limits worst-case losses

### 2. **Concentration Risk**
- Only 10 positions = higher volatility
- Single position can be 12-15% of portfolio
- **Mitigation:** Quarterly rebalancing diversifies over time

### 3. **Regime Detection Lag**
- 200-day MA takes time to signal regime change
- May experience 5-15% loss before switching to GLD
- **Mitigation:** Acceptable tradeoff for avoiding whipsaws

### 4. **Bull Market Dependency**
- Strategy thrived in 2014-2024 bull market (64.6% STRONG BULL)
- Performance uncertain in prolonged sideways market
- **Mitigation:** GLD protection limits downside

### 5. **Walk-Forward Questions**
- Only 30% annual win rate (but methodology issue)
- Need to monitor quarterly performance closely
- **Mitigation:** Deploy small capital first (Phase 2)

## 🎯 Why This Strategy Works

### 1. **Momentum Principle**
- Strongest stocks tend to stay strong (momentum persistence)
- Captures major market trends (e.g., tech 2020-2021, energy 2022)
- Quarterly rebalancing captures 3-6 month trends

### 2. **Regime Filtering**
- Exits stocks during major corrections
- GLD tends to rally when stocks fall (negative correlation)
- Protects capital for next bull market entry

### 3. **Relative Strength**
- Only buys stocks outperforming SPY
- Avoids laggards and value traps
- Ensures capital deployed to market leaders

### 4. **Quarterly Rebalancing**
- Low enough frequency to avoid whipsaws (vs monthly)
- High enough to capture emerging winners (vs annual)
- Optimal for momentum strategies (3-6 month holding periods)
