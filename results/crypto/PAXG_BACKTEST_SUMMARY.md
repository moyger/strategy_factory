## PAXG Bear Market Performance

The strategy successfully identified and traded bear regimes:

4. **Sep 2024:** Multiple short switches → **+$7,500 net**

6. **Apr 2025:** Extended bear period → **+$12,080 profit**

**Key Observation:** PAXG generated positive returns in ALL major bear periods, protecting capital and generating alpha while crypto was declining.

---

## Regime Switching Logic

The strategy uses BTC's 200-day moving average to determine regime:

### BULL / NEUTRAL Regime (BTC > 200MA)
- Trade crypto perpetuals (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- Use Donchian breakouts + ADX + relative strength
- Dynamic leverage (0.5-2×) based on market conditions
- 2× ATR trailing stops

### BEAR Regime (BTC < 200MA)
- **Exit all crypto positions**
- **Allocate 100% to PAXG-USD**
- Hold as spot position (no leverage)
- Generate returns from gold's safe-haven bid

**Result:** This regime filter prevented catastrophic losses during crypto bear markets and actually PROFITED during downturns.
