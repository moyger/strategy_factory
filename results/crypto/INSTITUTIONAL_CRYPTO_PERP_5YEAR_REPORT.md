## Comparison: 2-Year vs 5-Year Results

| Metric | 2-Year (2023-2025) | 5-Year (2020-2025) | Change |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Total Return | +101.81% | +88.52% | Lower (includes 2021-2022 crash) |
| CAGR | 27.35% | 9.14% | Lower (averaged over longer period) |
| Sharpe Ratio | 2.22 | 0.85 | Lower (more volatility in full period) |
| Max Drawdown | -6.52% | -21.66% | Worse (2021-2022 bear market) |
| Win Rate | 75.6% | 61.1% | Lower (more trades, more varied conditions) |
| Trades | 41 | 131 | More data, more reliable |

**Key Insight:** The 2-year backtest (2023-2025) was during a **bull market recovery**, showing exceptional results. The 5-year backtest includes the brutal 2021-2022 bear market, providing a more realistic view of long-term performance.

**The 5-year results are MORE RELIABLE** because they include a full market cycle (bull → bear → bull).

## Critical Observations

### 1. PAXG Saved the Strategy in 2021-2022 Bear Market

During the 851 days of BEAR regime (2021-2022), the strategy:
- Exited all crypto positions
- Allocated 100% to PAXG
- Generated **+$19,451** profit while BTC crashed -75%
- Preserved capital for the 2023-2024 recovery

**Without PAXG:** The strategy would have experienced catastrophic losses (-40% to -60% drawdown).
**With PAXG:** Max drawdown was limited to -21.66%.

### 2. Strategy Performs Best in Trending Markets

**Strong Performance:**
- Fold 5 (Feb-Dec 2024): +42.18% during crypto rally
- Fold 6 (Dec 2024-Oct 2025): +27.63% during continued strength
- BULL_RISK_ON regime: +$71,960 profit

**Weak Performance:**
- Fold 1 (Oct 2020-Aug 2021): -14.25% during mania top
- Fold 4 (Apr 2023-Feb 2024): -1.99% during sideways action
- NEUTRAL regime: -$2,890 (minimal activity)

**Recommendation:** Consider adding range-bound filters or reducing position size during NEUTRAL regimes.

### 3. Walk-Forward Shows Improving Performance

Recent folds are significantly better than early folds:
- Folds 1-4 (2020-2024): Average +2.25%, inconsistent
- Folds 5-6 (2024-2025): Average +34.91%, strong and consistent ⭐

This suggests the strategy is **well-adapted to current market conditions** (2024-2025).

2. **Survived 2021-2022 crypto bear market** (-75% BTC crash)
3. **PAXG allocation works** (+$19K during bear periods)
4. **66.7% walk-forward consistency** (4/6 positive folds)
