# Deep Skeptical Analysis: Crypto Hybrid Strategy

**Date:** 2025-01-14
**Strategy:** 06_nick_radge_crypto_hybrid.py
**Claimed Performance:** +9,825% (2020-2025)
**Analyst:** Critical Review

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: MULTIPLE CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

🚨 **STATUS:** **HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS - DO NOT DEPLOY**

After deep analysis, I've identified **multiple critical bugs and methodological flaws** that make the reported +9,825% return **unreliable and likely inflated**:

### Critical Issues

1. **BUG 15: VectorBT Price Error** - Strategy crashes with "price must be finite and greater than 0"
2. **Rebalancing Discipline Unclear** - Despite Bug 13 "fix", trade count still seems high (476 trades over 1,989 days)
3. **No Parameter Optimization Disclosure** - Were these parameters optimized on the same data?
4. **No Walk-Forward Validation** - Strategy never tested on true out-of-sample data
5. **No Monte Carlo Simulation** - No confidence intervals or uncertainty quantification
6. **Survivorship Bias Risk** - Using current top 50 cryptos (many didn't exist in 2020)
7. **Cherry-Picked Period** - 2020-2025 is the greatest crypto bull market in history
8. **No Slippage/Execution Costs** - Real crypto trading has significant spread costs
9. **Regime Filter Look-Ahead Potential** - MA calculations need verification
10. **Allocation Logic Bugs** - Complex pending rebalance logic may have edge cases

---

## 1. CRITICAL BUG FOUND: VectorBT Price Error

### Evidence

```
ValueError: order.price must be finite and greater than 0
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The strategy crashes when testing "Pure Dynamic" allocation (100% satellite, 0% core). This indicates:

**The allocation matrix is setting non-zero allocations for assets with NaN or ≤0 prices**

### Where It Happens

Looking at lines 410-443 in [06_nick_radge_crypto_hybrid.py](strategies/06_nick_radge_crypto_hybrid.py):

```python
# FIX: Only allocate to satellites with valid prices (not NaN)
valid_satellites = [t for t in current_satellite
                  if t in prices.columns and not pd.isna(prices.at[date, t]) and prices.at[date, t] > 0]
```

**This validation happens AFTER satellite selection**, which means:

1. `select_satellite()` (lines 189-239) picks assets based on indicators
2. Indicators are calculated using **lagged prices** (`.shift(1)`)
3. An asset can have valid lagged price but NaN current price
4. **Result:** Strategy tries to buy/sell at NaN price → VectorBT crashes

### Why This Slipped Through

The "successful" backtest only worked because:
- It used 70% core (BTC/ETH/SOL) which have complete history
- 30% satellite is small enough that a few NaN allocations got filtered
- **Pure dynamic (100% satellite) exposes the bug immediately**

### Impact on Reported Results

**The +9,825% return may have included trades at invalid prices, or the strategy got "lucky" with partial allocations that masked the bug.**

---

## 2. REBALANCING DISCIPLINE ANALYSIS

### Claimed Behavior

From code comments:
- "Core (70%): Fixed BTC, ETH, SOL - NEVER rebalanced"
- "Satellite (30%): Top 5 alts - Quarterly rebalanced"
- Bug 13 fix: "Only rebalance on actual rebalance/regime-change days"

### Reported Results

```
- Rebalance triggers: 122 days (5.8%)
- Hold days (NaN): 1,989 (94.2%)
- Total trades: 476
```

### Skeptical Analysis

**476 trades / 122 rebalance days = ~3.9 trades per rebalance day**

This seems reasonable for a portfolio that:
- Has 3 core assets (rarely trade)
- Has 5 satellites (rebalance quarterly)
- Switches to PAXG in bear markets

But let's verify:
- **Expected quarterly rebalances:** 5.8 years × 4 = ~23 quarters
- **Reported quarterly dates:** 24 (matches!)
- **Regime changes:** ~98 (seems high - need verification)

**Question:** Did BTC really change regime 98 times in 5.8 years? That's ~17 regime changes per year, or ~1 every 3 weeks. This seems excessive.

### Potential Issue: Regime Whipsaw

Looking at regime logic (lines 110-139):

```python
ma_long = btc_prices.rolling(window=200).mean().shift(1)
ma_short = btc_prices.rolling(window=100).mean().shift(1)

regime[(prices_lagged > ma_long) & (prices_lagged > ma_short)] = 'STRONG_BULL'
regime[(prices_lagged > ma_long) & (prices_lagged <= ma_short)] = 'WEAK_BULL'
regime[prices_lagged <= ma_long] = 'BEAR'
```

**Problem:** No hysteresis or smoothing. BTC whipsawing around the 200MA or 100MA will cause:
- Frequent regime flips
- Excessive rebalancing
- Over-trading (kills returns with fees)

**This explains the 98 regime changes!**

### Realistic Trade Expectation

If we assume:
- **Quarterly satellite rebalancing:** 24 × 5 satellites = 120 trades
- **Regime changes (conservative):** 10 major changes × 8 assets = 80 trades
- **Total expected:** ~200 trades

**Actual: 476 trades (2.4× expected)**

**This suggests the strategy is still over-trading, despite Bug 13 "fix".**

---

## 3. NO WALK-FORWARD VALIDATION

### Missing Critical Test

From [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md):

> **Full Backtest Requirements:**
> 1. Performance Backtest ✅
> 2. QuantStats Report ✅ (MANDATORY)
> 3. Walk-Forward Validation ✅ (MANDATORY)
> 4. Monte Carlo Simulation ✅ (MANDATORY)

**The strategy has NEVER been walk-forward validated!**

### What This Means

Every parameter in this strategy may be overfit to the full 2020-2025 period:
- Core assets: Why BTC/ETH/SOL? Why not BTC/ETH/BNB?
- Satellite size: Why 5? Why not 3 or 7?
- Regime MA periods: Why 200/100? Why not 200/50 like stock strategies?
- Core/satellite split: Why 70/30? Why not 80/20 or 60/40?
- Qualifier: Why TQS? Why not ML or hybrid?

**Without walk-forward, we have ZERO evidence this will work going forward.**

---

## 4. NO MONTE CARLO SIMULATION

### Missing Risk Quantification

Monte Carlo simulation resamples trades to create confidence intervals:

```
Example Output:
- Mean Return: +9,825%
- 90% CI: [+4,000%, +15,000%]
- Probability of Profit: 92%
- 5th Percentile: +2,500%
```

**We don't know if +9,825% is:**
- The expected outcome (good)
- The luckiest 95th percentile (bad - not repeatable)
- Driven by a few huge wins (very bad - fragile)

### Trade Distribution Analysis Needed

Critical questions:
- Are returns normally distributed or fat-tailed?
- What % of returns come from the top 10% of trades?
- Is this a "lottery ticket" strategy (many small losses, one huge win)?

**Without Monte Carlo, we're flying blind.**

---

## 5. SURVIVORSHIP BIAS RISK

### The Top 50 Crypto Problem

The backtest uses "top 50 cryptos" from 2025:

```python
top_50_cryptos = [
    'BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD', 'BNB-USD', 'SOL-USD', 'XRP-USD',
    'ADA-USD', 'AVAX-USD', 'DOGE-USD', 'DOT-USD', 'MATIC-USD',
    # ... 40 more
]
```

**Problem:** Many of these didn't exist in 2020 or were tiny:
- SOL launched September 2020 (not in top 50 initially)
- AVAX launched September 2020 (not in top 50 initially)
- Many others launched 2021-2022

**By using the 2025 top 50, we're selecting cryptos that SURVIVED and THRIVED.**

### Correct Methodology

Use **point-in-time top 50**:
- Jan 2020: Top 50 as of Jan 2020
- Jan 2021: Top 50 as of Jan 2021
- Etc.

This includes dead coins, rugs, and failures (realistic).

### Impact on Results

Survivorship bias can inflate returns by 50-300% in crypto. Example:
- **With survivors:** Backtest includes SOL (+10,000%)
- **Without survivors:** Would have included failed coins like FTX, LUNA, etc.

**The +9,825% return may be massively inflated due to survivor bias.**

---

## 6. CHERRY-PICKED PERIOD

### The Luckiest Period in Crypto History

**Nov 2020 - Jan 2025:**
- BTC: $13,000 → $100,000 (7.7×)
- ETH: $400 → $3,500 (8.75×)
- SOL: $2 → $200+ (100×)

This period includes:
- 2020 COVID recovery
- 2021 mega bull market
- 2022 bear market (but recovers)
- 2023-2024 recovery
- 2024-2025 all-time highs

**This is THE golden age of crypto. Testing only on this period is textbook curve-fitting.**

### Realistic Test Periods

Should test on:
- **2017-2018:** Bull then crash (-80%)
- **2018-2020:** Multi-year bear market
- **2014-2015:** Mt. Gox collapse
- **Out-of-sample 2025+:** True forward test

**A strategy that works 2020-2025 may fail catastrophically 2026+.**

---

## 7. ALLOCATION LOGIC COMPLEXITY

### Pending Rebalance State Machine

Lines 297-488 implement a complex state machine:

```python
pending_initial = True
pending_quarterly_rebalance = False
pending_regime_change = False
rebalance_idx = 0

# Complex logic with multiple conditions...
if should_rebalance_satellite:
    # Execute pending
    if pending_initial:
        pending_initial = False
    if pending_quarterly_rebalance:
        while rebalance_idx < len(actual_rebalance_dates)...
```

**This is bug-prone code.** Potential issues:

1. **Race conditions:** What if regime changes on a quarterly rebalance day?
2. **State corruption:** What if multiple flags are True simultaneously?
3. **Lost updates:** What if a rebalance executes but flags don't clear?
4. **Infinite pending:** What if NaNs last for weeks? (All rebalances queue up)

### Edge Cases Not Tested

- [ ] Regime changes on quarterly rebalance day
- [ ] Multiple consecutive days with NaN prices
- [ ] All satellites filtered out (no valid targets)
- [ ] PAXG missing data during bear market
- [ ] Asset starts trading mid-backtest (SOL in Nov 2020)

**Complex state machines need extensive unit tests. This has NONE.**

---

## 8. NO SLIPPAGE/EXECUTION COSTS

### Unrealistic Cost Assumptions

Current settings:
```python
fees = 0.001  # 0.1%
slippage = 0.0005  # 0.05%
```

**Real crypto trading costs:**
- Maker fees: 0.02-0.1% (reasonable)
- Taker fees: 0.05-0.2% (backtest uses 0.1% - OK)
- Slippage on rebalance: 0.1-0.5% for large orders (backtest uses 0.05% - **too optimistic**)
- Spread costs: 0.05-0.5% (NOT MODELED)
- Price impact: 0.1-1% for large orders (NOT MODELED)

### Impact on Returns

With 476 trades and $9.9M final value:
- Average position size: ~$20,000+
- Total spread cost: 476 × 0.2% = 95.2% of capital (over time)
- **This could reduce returns by 10-30%**

**Real slippage for a $9.9M rebalance in altcoins could be 1-5%.**

---

## 9. REGIME FILTER VERIFICATION

### Look-Ahead Bias Check

Lines 128-130:
```python
ma_long = btc_prices.rolling(window=200).mean().shift(1)
ma_short = btc_prices.rolling(window=100).mean().shift(1)
prices_lagged = btc_prices.shift(1)
```

**This looks correct** - using `.shift(1)` prevents look-ahead bias. ✅

But verify:
- On day T, we calculate MA using prices up to day T-1
- On day T, we use price from day T-1
- Decision on day T is based on T-1 data
- Trade executes at day T close

**This is correct IF we assume trade execution at T close after decision at T open.**

### Potential Issue: Intraday Look-Ahead

If strategy assumes:
- Decision made at T open
- Execution at T open price

Then using T close in backtest = look-ahead bias (know T close before trading).

**Need to verify VectorBT execution timing.**

---

## 10. PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION TRANSPARENCY

### Undisclosed Optimization

No documentation of:
- How parameters were chosen
- What alternatives were tested
- Whether parameters were optimized in-sample

**Classic research bias:** Try 100 parameter combinations, report the best one.

### Degrees of Freedom

This strategy has ~15 tunable parameters:
- Core allocation (70%)
- Satellite allocation (30%)
- Core assets ([BTC, ETH, SOL])
- Satellite size (5)
- Qualifier type (TQS)
- MA period (100)
- Regime MA long (200)
- Regime MA short (100)
- Rebalance freq (QS)
- Bear asset (PAXG)
- Weak bull reduction (50%)
- Momentum weighting (True)

**With 15 parameters and ~5 choices each: 5^15 = 30 billion combinations!**

**The odds of randomly picking the "best" combination are essentially zero.**

**Therefore, these parameters MUST have been optimized, but this is not disclosed.**

---

## 11. COMPARISON TO BENCHMARK

### What's Missing

No comparison to:
- Buy-and-hold BTC
- Buy-and-hold 60/40 BTC/ETH
- Simple equal-weight top 10
- S&P 500 (included in reports but not analyzed)

### Quick Sanity Check

**BTC Performance (2020-2025):**
- Start: ~$10,000 (Jan 2020)
- End: ~$100,000 (Oct 2025)
- Return: +900%

**Strategy Performance:**
- Return: +9,825%

**Strategy beats BTC by 10.9×**

**Is this plausible?**

For a 70% BTC/ETH/SOL strategy to beat BTC by 11×:
- The 30% satellite must have returned +30,000%+ (300×)
- Or the regime timing must be perfect
- Or there's a bug

**This is extraordinarily suspicious.**

---

## 12. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Positive Aspects

✅ Uses vectorbt (industry standard)
✅ Attempts to prevent look-ahead bias (`.shift(1)`)
✅ Handles NaN prices explicitly
✅ Clear regime filter logic
✅ Modular design (qualifiers, regime, allocation)

### Critical Weaknesses

❌ **No unit tests**
❌ **No integration tests**
❌ **No edge case tests**
❌ **Complex state machine (bug-prone)**
❌ **No logging/debugging for trade decisions**
❌ **No assertion checks**
❌ **Type hints incomplete**
❌ **Error handling minimal**

### Specific Code Smells

**1. Allocating to assets before checking price validity (FIXED but may have edge cases)**

**2. Complex nested conditionals (lines 391-488):**
- 8 levels of nesting in places
- Hard to reason about all paths
- Prone to off-by-one errors

**3. Silent failures:**
```python
try:
    win_rate = strategy._safe_scalar(portfolio.trades.win_rate()) * 100
except:
    win_rate = 0.0
```
Bare `except` catches everything (including bugs).

**4. Magic numbers:**
```python
if pct_zero > 10:  # Why 10%?
if len(valid_cols) < len(tickers):  # No threshold
```

---

## 13. VECTORBT USAGE ANALYSIS

### Portfolio Construction

Lines 752-763:
```python
portfolio = vbt.Portfolio.from_orders(
    close=prices,
    size=allocations,
    size_type='targetpercent',
    fees=0.001,
    slippage=0.0005,
    init_cash=initial_capital,
    cash_sharing=True,
    group_by=True,
    call_seq='auto',
    freq='D'
)
```

### Critical Parameters

**`size_type='targetpercent'`:**
- Rebalances to target weights on every non-NaN row
- This is correct for the strategy design
- NaN rows → hold positions (no rebalance)

**`cash_sharing=True`:**
- Cash is shared across all assets (single portfolio)
- Correct for this strategy ✅

**`call_seq='auto'`:**
- VectorBT optimizes order execution
- May not match real execution
- Could inflate returns slightly

**`freq='D'`:**
- Daily frequency
- Assumes daily rebalancing is possible
- May not be realistic for large portfolios

### Potential Issues

1. **Auto call sequence** may generate unrealistic execution orders
2. **No max position size constraint** (could allocate $10M to a small-cap alt)
3. **No liquidity constraints** (assumes infinite liquidity)
4. **No market impact model** (large orders don't move price)

---

## 14. TRADE COUNT RECONCILIATION

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected trades (conservative):**
- Quarterly satellite rebalancing: 24 quarters × 5 satellites × 2 (buy+sell) = 240 trades
- Regime changes: 10 major changes × 8 assets × 2 = 160 trades
- **Total: ~400 trades**

**Actual: 476 trades**

**Difference: +76 trades (19% over expected)**

### Possible Explanations

1. **More regime changes than estimated** (98 instead of 10)
2. **Partial rebalances** (some satellites unavailable, trade in/out when available)
3. **Bug in rebalance logic** (some trades shouldn't happen)
4. **Correct behavior** (regime whipsaw is real)

### Test Required

Print detailed trade log:
- Date
- Asset
- Type (BUY/SELL)
- Reason (INITIAL/QUARTERLY/REGIME_CHANGE)
- Price
- Size

**Without this, we can't verify correct execution.**

---

## 15. RECOMMENDATION: STOP AND FIX

### DO NOT DEPLOY THIS STRATEGY

Until the following are completed:

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Bugs
- [ ] Fix Bug 15 (VectorBT price error)
- [ ] Add regime filter hysteresis (prevent whipsaw)
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Add unit tests for allocation logic
- [ ] Add edge case tests

### Phase 2: Validate Methodology
- [ ] Walk-forward validation (minimum 3 folds)
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation (1000+ runs)
- [ ] Out-of-sample test (2026+ data when available)
- [ ] Point-in-time universe (fix survivorship bias)
- [ ] Multiple period tests (2017-2018, 2018-2020, etc.)

### Phase 3: Improve Realism
- [ ] Increase slippage to 0.2-0.5%
- [ ] Add spread cost model
- [ ] Add price impact model
- [ ] Add liquidity constraints
- [ ] Add position size limits

### Phase 4: Transparency
- [ ] Document all parameter choices
- [ ] Disclose optimization process
- [ ] Show alternative parameter sets
- [ ] Compare to simple benchmarks
- [ ] Publish all test results (not just winners)

---

## CONCLUSION

**The reported +9,825% return is NOT TRUSTWORTHY.**

**Evidence of problems:**
1. ✅ **Bug found** (VectorBT price error)
2. ✅ **Excessive regime changes** (98 in 5.8 years)
3. ✅ **No walk-forward validation**
4. ✅ **No Monte Carlo**
5. ✅ **Likely survivorship bias**
6. ✅ **Cherry-picked period**
7. ✅ **Undisclosed optimization**
8. ✅ **Unrealistic costs**

**My skeptical estimate of TRUE forward performance:**
- **Optimistic:** +2,000-3,000% (still excellent, but 1/3 of claimed)
- **Realistic:** +800-1,500% (good, but not extraordinary)
- **Pessimistic:** +200-500% (merely matches BTC buy-and-hold)

**The strategy MAY be profitable, but needs extensive validation before deployment.**

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

1. **Fix Bug 15** - Allocation to assets with NaN prices
2. **Add trade logging** - Print every trade with reason
3. **Run point-in-time backtest** - Fix survivorship bias
4. **Implement walk-forward** - Test on unseen data
5. **Run Monte Carlo** - Quantify uncertainty
6. **Compare to BTC buy-and-hold** - Sanity check
7. **Test 2017-2018 period** - Does it survive bear markets?

**Only after ALL of the above should this strategy be considered for live deployment.**
