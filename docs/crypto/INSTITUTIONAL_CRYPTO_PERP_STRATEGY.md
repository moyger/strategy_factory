## Strategy Philosophy

**Core Principle:** *"Only be aggressive when the wind's at your back."*

This strategy is designed to:
1. **Capture explosive crypto rallies** during favorable market regimes
2. **Avoid bear market devastation** through strict regime filtering
3. **Scale into winners** via pyramid adds
4. **Cut losers quickly** with ATR trailing stops
5. **Limit catastrophic losses** with daily loss limits

---

## Strategy Components

### 1. Regime Filter (BTC-Based Market Classification)

**Three Regimes:**

| Regime | Conditions | Max Leverage | Behavior |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **BULL_RISK_ON** | BTC > 200MA AND 20MA slope > 0 AND vol 20-150 percentile | 1.5× | Aggressive: Full entry signals |
| **NEUTRAL** | Some conditions met | 1.0× | Cautious: Reduced entries |
| **BEAR_RISK_OFF** | BTC < 200MA | 0.5× | Defensive: Exit all positions |

**Historical Distribution (Oct 2023 - Oct 2025):**
- BULL_RISK_ON: 16% of days
- NEUTRAL: 42% of days
- BEAR_RISK_OFF: 42% of days

**Why This Works:**
- Crypto is highly correlated with BTC
- Most altcoins crash when BTC enters bear markets
- Missing bear markets is more important than catching every rally

---

### 2. Entry System (Triple Confirmation)

Entries require **ALL THREE** conditions:

#### A. Donchian Breakout (20-Day High)
- Price breaks above 20-day high
- Indicates strong momentum

#### B. ADX Confirmation (> 20)
- ADX > 20 indicates trending market
- **Crypto-adapted:** Lower than traditional 25 threshold
- Filters out choppy, range-bound moves

#### C. Relative Strength Filter (Top 50%)
- Must be in top half of performance vs BTC
- Ensures you're buying winners, not laggards
- **Crypto-adapted:** Top 50% instead of top quartile (too restrictive for crypto)

**Example Entry:**
```
Date: Nov 14, 2024
Symbol: XRP-USD
Price: $0.77 (breaks above $0.75 20-day high)
ADX: 28.5 (trending)
RS vs BTC: 1.85 (top 50%)
Regime: BULL_RISK_ON
→ BUY SIGNAL TRIGGERED
```

---

### 3. Pyramid Adds (Scale Into Winners)

- **Max 3 adds** per position
- **Trigger:** Price moves +0.75×ATR from last entry/add
- **Sizing:** Same size as initial position

**Why This Works:**
- Winning trades often become BIG winners in crypto
- Pyramiding lets you maximize winning positions
- ATR-based spacing prevents adding too early

**Example Pyramid:**
```
Entry: XRP at $0.77 (1,000 units)
Add #1: XRP at $0.89 (1,000 units) [+0.75×ATR]
Add #2: XRP at $1.12 (1,000 units) [+0.75×ATR]
Add #3: XRP at $1.25 (1,000 units) [+0.75×ATR]
Total position: 4,000 units (avg entry $1.01)

Exit: XRP at $1.42 (+83% profit on entry)
Profit: $1,640 on $3,040 invested = +54% realized return
```

---

### 4. Exit System (Three Exit Conditions)

Positions are closed when **ANY** of these triggers:

#### A. 2×ATR Trailing Stop (Profit Protection)
- Stop trails 2×ATR below highest price reached
- Protects profits in winning trades
- Example: Entry $100, reaches $150, ATR $10
  - Trail stop: $150 - (2×$10) = $130
  - Locks in $30 profit minimum

#### B. 10-Day Low Breakdown (Momentum Reversal)
- Price breaks below 10-day low
- Indicates momentum has reversed
- Exits losing positions quickly

#### C. Regime Change to BEAR_RISK_OFF (Risk Management)
- BTC drops below 200MA → immediate exit
- Protects from prolonged bear markets
- Example: Aug 3, 2024 → All positions closed as BTC crashed

---

### 5. Position Sizing (Vol-Adjusted Fixed Allocation)

**Base Allocation:** 10% of equity per position

**Volatility Adjustment:**
- Higher volatility → Smaller position
- Lower volatility → Larger position
- Formula: `base_notional × (0.5 / volatility)`

**Leverage Caps:**
- BULL: Max 1.5× leverage per position
- NEUTRAL: Max 1.0× leverage
- BEAR: Max 0.5× leverage

**Example:**
```
Account equity: $100,000
Base allocation: $10,000 (10%)
Asset volatility: 80% annualized

Vol-adjusted size: $10,000 × (0.5 / 0.8) = $6,250
Leverage used: 0.625× (conservative)

If volatility was 40%:
Vol-adjusted size: $10,000 × (0.5 / 0.4) = $12,500
Leverage used: 1.25× (capped at 1.5×)
```

---

### 6. Risk Controls (Hard Limits)

#### A. Daily Loss Limit (-3%)
- If daily P&L drops below -3% → **CLOSE ALL POSITIONS**
- Prevents catastrophic drawdowns
- Example: Dec 9, 2024 → -28.95% avoided by closing all positions at -3%

#### B. No Weekend De-Grossing (Crypto-Specific)
- Unlike equities, crypto trades 24/7
- No need to close positions on Friday
- Maintains exposure through weekends

#### C. Max 10 Positions
- Portfolio concentration limit
- Ensures adequate diversification
- Prevents over-trading

## Key Insights from Backtest

### What Worked

1. **Pyramid adds captured explosive moves**
   - XRP: 3 adds turned $20k into $99k profit
   - ARB: Multiple adds captured +139% move

2. **Daily loss limit prevented catastrophe**
   - Dec 9, 2024: Would have lost -28.95%, limited to -3%
   - Nov 13, 2024: Would have lost -13.78%, limited to -3%

3. **Regime filter avoided worst bear periods**
   - 42% of time in cash/defensive (BEAR_RISK_OFF)
   - Avoided Aug 2024 and Sep 2024 crashes

4. **Relative strength filter selected winners**
   - Top 10 performers all had RS > 0.5 at entry
   - Avoided laggards that crashed

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Win rate is low (36.9%)**
   - Strategy has many small losses, few big wins
   - Acceptable for high profit factor (3.46)
   - Consider tighter entry filters for higher quality

2. **Max drawdown still significant (-36.46%)**
   - Occurred during rapid market crashes
   - Daily loss limit helps but doesn't prevent all drawdowns
   - Consider lower leverage or tighter stops

3. **Trades concentrated in late 2024-2025**
   - Only 16% of days in BULL_RISK_ON
   - Strategy is inactive 84% of the time
   - Consider more aggressive NEUTRAL regime rules

## Live Trading Considerations

### Exchange Selection

**Recommended Exchanges:**
1. **Bybit** - Best for altcoin perpetuals
2. **OKX** - Lower fees, good liquidity
3. **Binance** - Largest volume, most pairs

**Avoid:**
- FTX (defunct)
- Small exchanges (low liquidity, delisting risk)

### Execution Details

**Order Types:**
- **Entry:** Market orders (immediate fill)
- **Pyramid adds:** Limit orders at entry + 0.75×ATR
- **Exits:** Stop-market orders (guarantee exit)

**Slippage Estimates:**
- Large caps (BTC, ETH): 0.05-0.1%
- Mid caps: 0.1-0.3%
- Small caps: 0.3-0.5%

**Fees (Bybit):**
- Maker: 0.02% (limit orders)
- Taker: 0.055% (market orders)
- Funding: ~0.01% per 8 hours (long positions)

### Capital Requirements

**Minimum Account Sizes:**
- **$25,000:** Can trade 1-2 positions at a time
- **$50,000:** Can trade 5 positions (half capacity)
- **$100,000:** Can trade full 10 positions (RECOMMENDED)
- **$250,000+:** Can scale up position sizes

**Why $100k minimum:**
- Each position is ~$10k
- 10 positions = full diversification
- Enough buffer for drawdowns

## Risk Warnings

### Crypto-Specific Risks

1. **Exchange Risk**
   - Hacks (Mt. Gox, FTX)
   - Delistings (coins removed from exchange)
   - Downtime during volatility
   - → Mitigation: Use multiple exchanges, withdraw profits

2. **Funding Rate Risk**
   - Long positions pay funding every 8 hours
   - Can be 0.01-0.3% per period (3-100% APR)
   - → Mitigation: Close positions if funding > 0.1%

3. **Liquidation Risk**
   - Using 1.5× leverage means 67% drawdown liquidates
   - Flash crashes can trigger liquidations
   - → Mitigation: Daily loss limit exits at -3%

4. **Regulation Risk**
   - Governments banning crypto trading
   - Exchange shutdowns (China 2021)
   - → Mitigation: Use offshore exchanges, VPN

### Strategy-Specific Risks

1. **Regime Whipsaw**
   - BTC oscillating around 200MA
   - Frequent entries/exits → high fees
   - → Mitigation: Use 5-day MA instead of daily

2. **Overnight Gaps**
   - Crypto trades 24/7 → no gaps
   - But exchanges can halt trading
   - → Mitigation: Use stop-loss orders

3. **Correlation Risk**
   - All altcoins move with BTC
   - Diversification provides little protection
   - → Mitigation: Accept correlation, use tight stops

## Parameter Optimization

### Current Parameters (Crypto-Adapted)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Max Positions | 10 | Balance diversification vs focus |
| BTC MA Long | 200 | Standard long-term trend |
| BTC MA Short | 20 | Short-term momentum |
| Vol Percentile Low | 20 | Lower for crypto (was 30) |
| Vol Percentile High | 150 | Higher for crypto (was 120) |
| Donchian Period | 20 | Standard breakout lookback |
| ADX Threshold | 20 | Lower for crypto (was 25) |
| RS Quartile | 0.50 | Top half (was 0.75 - too restrictive) |
| Add ATR Multiple | 0.75 | Frequent adds in trends |
| Max Adds | 3 | Limit risk concentration |
| Trail ATR Multiple | 2.0 | Standard trailing stop |
| Breakdown Period | 10 | Quick exit on reversals |
| Allocation per Position | 10% | Conservative sizing |
| Max Leverage Bull | 1.5× | Reduced for safety (was 2.0×) |
| Daily Loss Limit | -3% | Tight risk control |

### Potential Optimizations

**More Aggressive (Higher Returns, Higher Risk):**
- Increase ADX threshold to 15 (more entries)
- Increase max leverage to 2.0× (more exposure)
- Loosen daily loss limit to -5%

**More Conservative (Lower Returns, Lower Risk):**
- Increase ADX threshold to 25 (fewer entries)
- Decrease max leverage to 1.0× (less exposure)
- Tighten daily loss limit to -2%

**Recommended:** Start conservative, gradually loosen parameters based on live performance.
