## What Makes a Crypto Qualify?

### Selection Criteria

For a crypto to be selected, it must pass **two filters**:

#### 1. **Above 50-Day Moving Average**
- Ensures crypto is in an uptrend
- Filters out cryptos in prolonged downtrends
- ~50-70% of universe qualifies in bull markets
- ~0-20% qualify in bear markets

#### 2. **Top 5 by 30-Day ROC**
- Ranks by momentum (% change over last 30 days)
- Higher ROC = higher ranking
- Momentum weighting: higher ROC = larger allocation

### Real Example (March 2024 - Bull Market)

**All 18 cryptos passed 50MA filter:**

| Crypto | 30-Day ROC | Rank | Selected? |
|--------|------------|------|-----------|
| **DOGE** | +77% | 1 | ‚úÖ |
| **VET** | +73% | 2 | ‚úÖ |
| **FIL** | +66% | 3 | ‚úÖ |
| **UNI** | +57% | 4 | ‚úÖ |
| **ETH** | +50% | 5 | ‚úÖ |
| BTC | +47% | 6 | ‚ùå |
| ADA | +44% | 7 | ‚ùå |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Result:** Top 5 momentum leaders selected.

### Real Example (July 2024 - Bear Market)

**Only 1 crypto passed 50MA filter:**

| Crypto | Price vs 50MA | Selected? |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **AAVE** | +15% above MA | ‚úÖ (only option) |
| BTC | -8% below MA | ‚ùå |
| ETH | -12% below MA | ‚ùå |
| All others | Below MA | ‚ùå |

**Result:** 100% allocation to AAVE (only qualified crypto).

## Crypto vs Stock Selection Comparison

| Aspect | **Stocks (BSS)** | **Crypto (ROC)** |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Top pick frequency** | 15-20 times (UNH, JNJ) | 12-16 times (AAVE, UNI) |
| **Concentration** | Diversified (50 stocks) | Highly concentrated (18 cryptos) |
| **Selection stability** | Very stable (same stocks for quarters) | Highly volatile (changes every month) |
| **Average return** | +15-25% per selection | +920% per selection |
| **Risk** | Low (blue chips) | Extremely high (100% gains/losses common) |
| **Worst performer** | -5% to +5% | -84% (FIL) |
| **Best performer** | +100-200% | +9,366% (DOGE) |

**Key difference:** Crypto has 10-100x higher returns but also catastrophic failures.

## Current Market Snapshot (January 2025)

If we were to rebalance **today**, the top 5 would likely include:

### Candidates (Based on Recent Momentum):

1. **XRP** - SEC lawsuit resolution, institutional adoption
2. **ADA** - Chang hard fork success, DeFi growth
3. **BTC** - Spot ETF flows, halving cycle
4. **ETH** - ETF approval, staking adoption
5. **SOL** - (Not in our universe, but would rank #1)

**Note:** Actual selections depend on 30-day ROC calculated at next month-start.

## Practical Insights

### For Live Trading:

**‚úÖ Expect these cryptos to dominate selections:**
- **AAVE** - 33% of time (DeFi rallies)
- **UNI** - 31% of time (DEX volume spikes)
- **ADA/DOGE/MATIC** - 25% of time each (alt-season leaders)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Be prepared for:**
- **Concentration risk:** 5 positions only (vs 7-10 for stocks)
- **Monthly churn:** Portfolio changes completely some months
- **Zero selections:** May-July 2024 had only 1-0 qualified cryptos
- **Explosive moves:** +500% ROC happens (XLM Dec 2024)

### Position Sizing Example:

**December 2024 portfolio (actual):**

| Crypto | 30d ROC | Weight |
|--------|---------|--------|
| XLM | +512% | 37% (512/1400) |
| XRP | +352% | 25% (352/1400) |
| ADA | +224% | 16% (224/1400) |
| DOGE | +176% | 13% (176/1400) |
| DOT | +138% | 10% (138/1400) |

**Total ROC:** 1,402%
**Momentum weighting:** Higher ROC = bigger allocation

## Risk Management

### Crypto-Specific Risks:

1. **Rug pulls:** Projects can disappear (mitigated by using established coins)
2. **Exchange risk:** Coins can delist (use top 20 by market cap)
3. **Regulatory risk:** SEC lawsuits, bans (XRP survived, but others may not)
4. **Technical risk:** Smart contract exploits (DeFi protocols especially)
5. **Volatility:** -50% in a month is normal

### Mitigation Strategies:

‚úÖ **Use only established coins** (2019+ launch date)
‚úÖ **Top 20 market cap minimum** (liquidity + survival probability)
‚úÖ **Monthly rebalancing** (exit before total collapse)
‚úÖ **50MA filter** (avoids prolonged bear markets)
‚úÖ **5-position limit** (concentration = higher returns)

## Conclusion

**The crypto momentum strategy successfully identified explosive performers:**

- **DOGE** (+9,366%) selected 12 times
- **MATIC** (+2,307%) selected 12 times
- **BNB** (+2,228%) selected 11 times
- **AAVE** (+312%) selected 16 times (most consistent)

**Average return of selected cryptos: +920%**

This validates that **30-day ROC momentum is real in crypto**. The strategy captured moonshots (DOGE) while filtering out losers (FIL was only selected 7 times, limiting damage from its -84% decline).

For live trading, expect **AAVE, UNI, ADA, DOGE, and MATIC** to dominate selections during bull markets, with **BTC and ETH** providing stability during consolidations.
