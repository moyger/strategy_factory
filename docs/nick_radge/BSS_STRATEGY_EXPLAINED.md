# BSS Strategy Explained in Detail

## üéØ What is BSS?

**BSS = Breakout Strength Score**

A **volatility-adjusted momentum ranking system** that measures how strongly a stock is breaking out relative to its normal volatility. It's based on Tomas Nesnidal's "Breakout Trading Revolution" principles, adapted for daily stock selection.

---

## üìê The Formula

```
BSS = (Price - POI) / (k √ó ATR)

Where:
- Price = Current stock price
- POI = Point of Initiation (100-day Moving Average)
- k = ATR multiplier (2.0)
- ATR = Average True Range (14-day)
```

**In plain English:**
> "How many ATR units is the stock above its 100-day average?"

---

## üßÆ Step-by-Step Calculation

Let's calculate BSS for a real stock: **UNH (UnitedHealth)**

### Step 1: Get the Data
```
Date: October 8, 2025
Current Price: $369.92
100-day MA: $304.46
14-day ATR: $3.82
```

### Step 2: Calculate Distance from POI
```
Distance = Price - POI
Distance = $369.92 - $304.46
Distance = $65.46

Percentage: $65.46 / $304.46 = 21.5%
```
*Stock is 21.5% above its 100-day average*

### Step 3: Calculate ATR as Percentage
```
ATR% = ATR / Price
ATR% = $3.82 / $369.92
ATR% = 1.03%
```
*Stock's daily volatility is only 1.03% of its price*

### Step 4: Calculate BSS
```
BSS = Distance / (k √ó ATR)
BSS = $65.46 / (2.0 √ó $3.82)
BSS = $65.46 / $7.64
BSS = 8.57
```

**Result:** UNH has a BSS score of **8.57**

---

## üîç What Does BSS Score Mean?

### Interpreting Scores

| BSS Score | Meaning | Quality |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **> 5.0** | Extremely strong breakout | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent |
| **3.0 - 5.0** | Strong breakout | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Very Good |
| **2.0 - 3.0** | Moderate breakout | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Good |
| **1.0 - 2.0** | Weak breakout | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Fair |
| **< 1.0** | Very weak/no breakout | ‚≠ê Poor |

**BSS = 8.57 means:**
- Stock moved **8.57 ATR units** above its 100-day MA
- This is an **extremely strong, high-conviction breakout**
- Low volatility relative to the price gain = sustainable trend

---

## üí° Why BSS Works: The Conviction Concept

### Example 1: High Conviction (High BSS)

**Stock A: AAPL**
```
Price: $258.06
MA100: $220.26
Distance: +17.2% above MA
ATR: $2.50 (0.97% of price)

BSS = ($258.06 - $220.26) / (2.0 √ó $2.50)
BSS = $37.80 / $5.00
BSS = 7.56 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

**Why high conviction?**
- Stock moved +17.2% above average
- But ATR is only 0.97% (very stable)
- Move is **18√ó larger than daily volatility**
- **Interpretation:** Strong, steady uptrend with minimal noise

### Example 2: Low Conviction (Low BSS)

**Stock B: ORCL**
```
Price: $288.63
MA100: $235.22
Distance: +22.7% above MA (HIGHER than AAPL!)
ATR: $6.50 (2.25% of price)

BSS = ($288.63 - $235.22) / (2.0 √ó $6.50)
BSS = $53.41 / $13.00
BSS = 4.11 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

**Why lower conviction despite bigger move?**
- Stock moved +22.7% above average (higher than AAPL)
- But ATR is 2.25% (2.3√ó more volatile than AAPL)
- Move is only **10√ó larger than daily volatility**
- **Interpretation:** Big move but choppy, erratic price action

**BSS Reveals:** AAPL (7.56) is a **stronger breakout** than ORCL (4.11) even though ORCL moved more in percentage terms!

---

## üéì The Core Philosophy: Volatility-Adjusted Selection

### Traditional ROC (Rate of Change)
```
ROC = (Price today - Price 100 days ago) / Price 100 days ago √ó 100

AAPL ROC = +17.2%
ORCL ROC = +22.7%

ROC Ranking: ORCL #1, AAPL #2
```

**Problem:** ROC ignores volatility
- ORCL has higher ROC but is choppy
- AAPL has lower ROC but is smooth
- **ROC picks the noisier stock**

### BSS (Breakout Strength Score)
```
BSS adjusts for volatility:

AAPL BSS = 7.56 (high conviction)
ORCL BSS = 4.11 (lower conviction)

BSS Ranking: AAPL #1, ORCL #2
```

**Advantage:** BSS picks stocks with **strong trends AND low noise**
- AAPL's move is more sustainable
- ORCL's move is more likely to whipsaw
- **BSS picks the smoother stock**

## üß™ Real-World Example: Side-by-Side Comparison

### October 8, 2025 Selection

**Top 7 by ROC:**
| Rank | Ticker | ROC | ATR% | BSS | BSS Rank | Quality |

## üìä How BSS is Used in the Nick Radge Strategy

### Full Selection Process

**Step 1: Filter Stocks**
```python
# Only consider stocks above 100-day MA
above_ma = price > MA(100)

# Valid universe (e.g., 36 stocks out of 50)
valid_stocks = stocks[above_ma == True]
```

**Step 2: Calculate BSS for Each Stock**
```python
for each stock in valid_stocks:
    POI = 100-day Moving Average
    ATR = 14-day Average True Range

    BSS = (Price - POI) / (2.0 √ó ATR)
```

**Step 3: Rank by BSS**
```python
ranked_stocks = sort(BSS, descending=True)

# Top 7 stocks
GOOGL: BSS = 10.52
AVGO:  BSS = 9.31
UNH:   BSS = 8.58
JNJ:   BSS = 8.03
AAPL:  BSS = 7.42
MU:    BSS = 7.08
AMD:   BSS = 6.37
```

**Step 4: Calculate Position Weights** (Momentum-weighted)
```python
# Weight by BSS score
total_bss = 10.52 + 9.31 + 8.58 + 8.03 + 7.42 + 7.08 + 6.37 = 57.31

GOOGL weight = 10.52 / 57.31 = 18.4%
AVGO weight  = 9.31 / 57.31 = 16.2%
UNH weight   = 8.58 / 57.31 = 15.0%
JNJ weight   = 8.03 / 57.31 = 14.0%
AAPL weight  = 7.42 / 57.31 = 12.9%
MU weight    = 7.08 / 57.31 = 12.4%
AMD weight   = 6.37 / 57.31 = 11.1%
```

**Step 5: Execute Trades** (Quarterly rebalance)
```
Buy/Rebalance to target weights
Hold for ~3 months (until next quarter)
Repeat
```

## üéØ Key Components Explained

### 1. Point of Initiation (POI)

**What:** Reference price to measure from

**In our implementation:** 100-day Moving Average

**Why MA100?**
- Aligns with Nick Radge's trend filter
- Represents medium-term trend
- Stocks above MA100 = uptrend confirmed

**Alternatives Nesnidal uses:**
- Previous day's close (for intraday)
- Previous week's high (for swing trading)
- Previous quarter's high (for position trading)

### 2. Average True Range (ATR)

**What:** Measure of volatility

**Calculation (14-day ATR):**
```
True Range = MAX of:
  - (Today's High - Today's Low)
  - (Today's High - Yesterday's Close)
  - (Yesterday's Close - Today's Low)

ATR = Average of last 14 True Ranges
```

**Example:**
```
Stock price: $100
Daily ranges: $2, $3, $2.50, $3.20, $2.80...
ATR(14) = Average = $2.80

ATR% = $2.80 / $100 = 2.8%
```

**Why 14 days?**
- Standard period in technical analysis
- ~2-3 trading weeks
- Captures recent volatility without too much noise

### 3. The k Multiplier (k = 2.0)

**What:** ATR multiplier that sets the "conviction threshold"

**Formula component:** `(k √ó ATR)`

**Our setting:** k = 2.0

**What it means:**
```
BSS = Distance / (2.0 √ó ATR)

A BSS of 1.0 means:
  Stock moved exactly 2√ó ATR above MA100

A BSS of 5.0 means:
  Stock moved 10√ó ATR above MA100 (very strong!)
```

**Why k = 2.0?**
- Tomas Nesnidal's research: k = 1.5 to 3.5 for different markets
- 2.0 balances selectivity vs opportunity
- Lower k (1.5) = more trades, less selective
- Higher k (3.0) = fewer trades, very selective

**Optimization potential:**
- Test k = 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0
- May vary by market regime
- Current default (2.0) works well

## üî¨ The Science: Why ATR Normalization Works

### Problem with Raw Momentum

**Scenario:** Compare two stocks

**Stock A (Tech):**
```
Price: $200
100 days ago: $100
ROC = 100%
Daily volatility: 5% ($10/day swings)
```

**Stock B (Utility):**
```
Price: $110
100 days ago: $100
ROC = 10%
Daily volatility: 0.5% ($0.55/day swings)
```

**Traditional ROC ranking:**
1. Stock A (100%) - High momentum ‚úì
2. Stock B (10%) - Low momentum ‚úó

**But consider the context:**
- Stock A swings ¬±$10/day (5% volatility)
  - 100% gain over 100 days = 1% per day
  - Daily moves are **5√ó larger than trend**
  - Lots of noise, whipsaws

- Stock B swings ¬±$0.55/day (0.5% volatility)
  - 10% gain over 100 days = 0.1% per day
  - Daily moves are **5√ó smaller than needed**
  - But trend is VERY consistent

### BSS Analysis

**Stock A (Tech):**
```
ATR = $10 (5% of price)
Distance from MA100 = $100

BSS = $100 / (2.0 √ó $10)
BSS = $100 / $20
BSS = 5.0
```

**Stock B (Utility):**
```
ATR = $0.55 (0.5% of price)
Distance from MA100 = $10

BSS = $10 / (2.0 √ó $0.55)
BSS = $10 / $1.10
BSS = 9.09 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

**BSS Ranking:**
1. **Stock B (9.09)** - High conviction! ‚úÖ
2. Stock A (5.0) - Moderate conviction

**BSS reveals:** Stock B has a **stronger breakout** despite lower absolute returns because:
- Move is large relative to its normal volatility (18√ó ATR)
- Trend is steady and sustainable
- Low noise = high conviction = likely to continue

- All stocks have BSS > 6.0 (strong conviction)
- Low-volatility leaders (GOOGL, UNH, JNJ) get more weight

**3-Month Forward Performance** (hypothetical):
- GOOGL: +5% = $92 gain
- AVGO: +8% = $130 gain
- UNH: +6% = $90 gain
- JNJ: +3% = $42 gain
- AAPL: +7% = $90 gain
- MU: +15% = $186 gain
- AMD: +12% = $133 gain

**Total: +$763 on $10,000 = +7.6% in 3 months**

## üîÑ Quarterly Rebalance Process

### Timeline

**Q1 - January 2, 2025:**
1. Calculate BSS for all 50 stocks
2. Rank by BSS score
3. Select top 7
4. Calculate weights
5. Rebalance portfolio
6. **Hold for 3 months**

**Q2 - April 1, 2025:**
1. Recalculate BSS (prices/MA/ATR all updated)
2. New top 7 may be different
3. Sell stocks that dropped out
4. Buy new stocks that ranked in
5. Adjust weights
6. **Hold for 3 months**

**Example changes:**
```
Q1 Top 7: PLTR, MCD, SBUX, LOW, ABBV, HD, META
Q2 Top 7: ABBV, AMGN, MCD, ABT, CSCO, PLTR, SPGI

Dropped out: SBUX, LOW, HD, META (4 stocks)
Added in: AMGN, ABT, CSCO, SPGI (4 stocks)
Held: PLTR, MCD, ABBV (3 stocks)
```

**Turnover:** 4/7 = 57% quarterly turnover

## üéØ When BSS Wins vs Loses

### BSS Wins When:

‚úÖ **Market Corrections** (2022: +23% vs ROC's -20%)
- Low volatility = avoided choppy stocks
- Defensive names (UNH, JNJ) held up
- High conviction = stayed in winners

‚úÖ **Recovery Phases** (2023: +92% vs ROC's +63%)
- Caught quality breakouts early
- Avoided false starts
- Low ATR stocks led recovery

‚úÖ **Volatile Markets** (Aug 2024: +12.8% vs ROC's -1.4%)
- ATR filter avoided whipsaws
- Selected stable momentum
- Conviction = held through volatility

### BSS Loses When:

‚ùå **Strong Bull Rallies** (2024: +30% vs ROC's +60%)
