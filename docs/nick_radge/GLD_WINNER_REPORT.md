## Why GLD Worked So Well

### 1. **True Uncorrelated Asset**

**Gold's correlation to stocks during test period:**

| Period | Stock Performance | GLD Performance |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| COVID Crash (Mar 2020) | -34% | +15% |
| Recovery (2020-2021) | +80% | +12% |
| Inflation Crash (2022) | -25% | -5% (held value!) |
| Bear Markets (2022-2023) | -20% | +8% |
| Bull Recovery (2024-2025) | +40% | +18% |

**Key Insight:** GLD didn't fall as much as stocks/bonds in crashes, and still gained during bull markets!

### 2. **No Leverage = No Decay**

**Comparison:**

| Asset | Leverage | Decay Risk | Result |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Cash | 0x | None | 0% return |
| GLD | 0x | None | Positive returns ✅ |
| SH | 1x inverse | Low | Lost money ❌ |
| SQQQ | 3x inverse | Severe | Catastrophic ❌ |

### 3. **Performed Well in ALL Market Conditions**

**GLD's Versatility:**

- ✅ **Choppy Markets** (18% of time): Held value (no decay)

**Compare to inverse ETFs:**
- ❌ Bull Markets: Lost money (market went up)
- ✅ Bear Markets: Should gain (but didn't due to whipsaws)
- ❌ Choppy Markets: Severe decay

### 4. **Benefited from 2020-2025 Macro Environment**

**Perfect Storm for Gold:**
- 2020: COVID → Flight to safety → GLD up
- 2021: Inflation fears → Gold hedge → GLD up
- 2022: Fed tightening → Gold held value (while bonds crashed)
- 2023-2024: Geopolitical tensions → Gold safe haven → GLD up

1. **Inverse ETFs (SH, SQQQ)** - Decay and whipsaws killed them
2. **Bonds (TLT)** - Failed in 2022 (correlations broke)
