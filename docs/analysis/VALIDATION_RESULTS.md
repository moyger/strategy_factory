```python
InstitutionalCryptoPerp(
    max_positions=5,
    donchian_period=20,
    adx_threshold=25,
    max_leverage_bull=1.5,
    max_leverage_neutral=1.0,

## 4. Comparison: Walk-Forward vs Monte Carlo

| Aspect | Walk-Forward | Monte Carlo |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Type** | Time-based validation | Statistical validation |
| **Return** | +4.87% per quarter | +147.48% over 5 years |
| **Win Rate** | 69% | 99.9% |
| **Strength** | Tests robustness across time | Tests robustness to randomness |
| **Weakness** | Only 16 samples | Assumes trade independence |

**Interpretation:**
- Walk-forward shows **consistent** quarterly gains
- Monte Carlo shows **high probability** of long-term success
- Both methods validate strategy robustness

## 6. Limitations and Caveats

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Sample Size
- Walk-forward: Only 1 trade per 3-month period (limited)
- Longer test periods reduce trade frequency

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Market Regime Dependency
- Strategy only tested on 5 years (includes 1 major bear + 2 bulls)
- May not generalize to unprecedented market conditions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction Costs
- Backtest assumes constant slippage/fees
- Real-world costs may vary with market conditions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Leverage Assumptions
- Assumes 1.5√ó leverage is always available
- Funding rates not modeled (perpetual futures cost)
