## üí° Real-World Example: UNH vs ORCL

**Scenario:** October 2025 rebalance

### UNH (BSS picked, ROC didn't)

```
Price: $369.92
MA100: $304.46
Distance: +21.5% above MA
ATR: $3.82 (1.0% of price)

ROC Score: 36.6% ‚Üí Rank #9 (not selected)
BSS Score: 8.58 ‚Üí Rank #3 ‚úì SELECTED

Why BSS won:
- Low volatility (1.0% ATR) means high conviction
- Steady healthcare leader
- Institutional quality
- 21.5% gain with minimal noise
```

### ORCL (ROC picked, BSS didn't)

```
Price: $288.63
MA100: $235.22
Distance: +22.7% above MA
ATR: ~$6.50 (2.25% of price - estimated)

ROC Score: 81.5% ‚Üí Rank #3 ‚úì SELECTED
BSS Score: 3.52 ‚Üí Rank #23 (rejected)

Why BSS lost:
- Higher volatility (2.25% ATR) means lower conviction
- Choppy uptrend with whipsaws
- 81.5% ROC looks great, but erratic price action
- BSS sees this as risky, not confident
```

**Result over next quarter:**
- If UNH continues steady trend ‚Üí BSS wins (lower drawdown, smoother ride)
- If ORCL explodes higher ‚Üí ROC wins (captured momentum)
- If ORCL whipsaws ‚Üí BSS wins (avoided volatility)

**Historical data shows:** BSS's approach (conviction > momentum) delivers higher Sharpe ratio and lower drawdown.

## üß† Key Insights

### 1. BSS Finds "Boring Winners"

**Stocks ROC misses:**
- UNH, JNJ, AAPL, JPM, GS, META, AMZN
- These are **quality mega-caps with steady trends**
- Not "sexy" momentum plays
- But they deliver **consistent returns with low volatility**

### 2. BSS Avoids "Momentum Traps"

**Stocks BSS rejects:**
- ORCL (high ROC but choppy)
- PLTR (popular but volatile)
- INTC (big move but erratic)
- These can whipsaw and cause drawdowns

### 3. The ATR Filter Works

**BSS Formula:** `(Price - MA100) / (2.0 √ó ATR)`

This naturally filters:
- ‚úÖ **Low ATR + good gain** = HIGH score (conviction)
- ‚ùå **High ATR + big gain** = LOW score (risky)

**Example:**
- Stock A: +20% above MA, ATR=1% ‚Üí BSS = 10.0 ‚úì
- Stock B: +80% above MA, ATR=4% ‚Üí BSS = 10.0 ‚úì (same score!)
- Stock C: +80% above MA, ATR=8% ‚Üí BSS = 5.0 ‚ùå (rejected)

### 4. Sector Diversification

**BSS portfolio tends to include:**
- Tech: GOOGL, AAPL, CSCO, META
- Healthcare: UNH, JNJ, ABBV
- Finance: JPM, GS, MS, SCHW
- Consumer: MCD, DIS, HD, LOW

**ROC portfolio tends to include:**
- Heavy tech/semiconductor concentration
- NVDA, TSLA, PLTR, MU, AMD, ORCL, AVGO
- Less diversification
- Higher correlation = higher risk

   - Losers smaller (avoided volatile stocks)

4. **Fewer Trades** (808 vs 1,775)
   - 55% fewer trades
   - Lower transaction costs
   - More selective = higher quality

5. **Sector Balance**
