# ATR-Based Performance Qualifiers - FINAL RESULTS (WITH GLD)

## ✅ CORRECTED Analysis - GLD Bear Market Allocation Included

**IMPORTANT:** Initial analysis had missing GLD data, causing strategies to hold cash during BEAR regime instead of GLD. This significantly understated performance. **Results below are CORRECT with GLD 100% allocation during BEAR periods.**

---

## Executive Summary

Breakout Strength Score (BSS) delivers **256.24% total return** (+29% vs ROC's 198%) with the HIGHEST Sharpe ratio (1.69) and LOWEST drawdown (-16.2%) of all qualifiers tested.

## Key Findings

### 🥇 Winner: Breakout Strength Score (BSS)

**Why BSS Dominates:**

1. **Highest Total Return:** 256.24% (+29% vs ROC)
2. **Best Sharpe Ratio:** 1.69 (35% better than ROC's 1.25)
3. **Lowest Drawdown:** -16.25% (HALF of ROC's -32.05%!)
4. **Highest Win Rate:** 70.67% (vs ROC's 61.35%)
5. **Best Profit Factor:** 10.34 (vs ROC's 4.74)

**The Magic Formula:**
```python
BSS = (Price - MA100) / (2.0 × ATR)
```

**What makes it work:**
- **Conviction Filter:** Only selects stocks moving 2× ATR above their 100-day MA
- **Volatility-Adjusted:** High-volatility stocks need larger moves to score high
- **Expansion Detection:** Catches breakouts in the expansion phase (Nesnidal's principle)
- **Risk-Aware:** Lower ATR = more sustainable trend = higher score

### 🥈 Runner-Up: Trend Quality Score (TQS)

- Lower return (157.61%) BUT
- Excellent Sharpe (1.46) - 2nd best
- Low drawdown (-17.50%) - 2nd best
- Best choice for **defensive investors**

### 💡 Surprising Result: VEM Underperforms

Volatility Expansion Momentum (VEM) delivered 184% return but had:
- Higher drawdown (-30.76%)
- Lower Sharpe (1.23)
- Similar trades as ROC (1776 vs 1775)

**Why:** Volatility expansion doesn't always mean profitable breakout - can also signal panic/reversal.

### ❌ What Failed

**1. Risk-Adjusted Momentum (RAM):** 68.59% return - WORST performer
- Over-penalizes normal volatility
- Win rate only 40.91%
- Too conservative for bull market period

**2. Composite Score:** 53.94% return
- Averaging conflicting signals dilutes strong BSS signal
- **Lesson:** Pick the best qualifier, don't combine them

## The GLD Effect (Why This Matters)

**Without GLD (going to cash in BEAR):**
- ROC: 133.87% total return
- BSS: 196.78% total return

**With GLD (100% allocation in BEAR):**
- ROC: 198.16% total return (+64%)
- BSS: 256.24% total return (+59%)

**GLD Performance During Test Period:**
- 2020-2025: ~50% total return
- Acts as hedge during BEAR regime (27.2% of test period)
- Critical for the 3-tier regime strategy

## BSS Deep Dive

### Trade Statistics

- **Total Trades:** 808 (vs ROC's 1,775)
  - 55% fewer trades = lower transaction costs
  - More selective = higher quality signals

- **Win Rate:** 70.67% (vs ROC's 61.35%)
  - ATR filter improves signal quality
  - Fewer false breakouts

- **Profit Factor:** 10.34 (vs ROC's 4.74)
  - Wins are MUCH larger than losses
  - Riding strong trends with conviction

### Risk Metrics

- **Max Drawdown:** -16.25% (vs ROC's -32.05%)
  - HALF the downside risk!
  - ATR-adjusted entry = better risk management

- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.69 (vs ROC's 1.25)
  - Superior risk-adjusted returns
  - Consistency over volatility

### Example Trade Logic

**Stock Evaluation at Rebalance:**

| Stock | Price | MA100 | ATR | Distance from MA | BSS Score | Rank |
|-------|-------|-------|-----|------------------|-----------|------|
| NVDA | $140 | $100 | $8 | $40 (40%) | **2.50** | 1️⃣ |
| AAPL | $190 | $175 | $3 | $15 (8.6%) | **2.50** | 1️⃣ |
| TSLA | $260 | $200 | $25 | $60 (30%) | **1.20** | 7️⃣ |

**Interpretation:**
- NVDA & AAPL: Same BSS (2.50) despite different % moves
  - NVDA: +40% above MA but high ATR ($8) = volatile
  - AAPL: +8.6% above MA but low ATR ($3) = stable
  - **Equal conviction despite different volatility**

- TSLA: Lower BSS (1.20) despite +30% move
  - Very high ATR ($25) = erratic price action
  - Breakout lacks conviction = avoid

## Implementation Guide

### For Production Use

**Recommended Configuration:**

```python
from strategy_factory.performance_qualifiers import get_qualifier

# BSS with optimized parameters
bss = get_qualifier('bss',
    poi_period=100,    # 100-day MA as Point of Initiation
    atr_period=14,     # Standard ATR period
    k=2.0              # Require 2× ATR move for conviction
)

# Use in Nick Radge strategy
strategy = NickRadgeEnhanced(
    portfolio_size=7,
    qualifier_type='bss',
    bear_market_asset='GLD',  # CRITICAL!
    bear_allocation=1.0,
    use_regime_filter=True,
    rebalance_freq='QS'
)
```

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run comparison yourself
venv/bin/python examples/compare_qualifiers.py

# 2. Generate visualization
venv/bin/python examples/visualize_qualifier_results.py

# 3. Review results
cat results/qualifier_comparison.csv
open results/qualifier_comparison.png
```

### Paper Trading Checklist

Before going live:

✅ Update `deployment/config_live.json`:
```json
{
  "ranking_method": "bss",
  "bss_k_multiplier": 2.0,
  "bss_poi_period": 100,
  "bear_market_asset": "GLD",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

✅ Monitor for 1 month minimum

✅ Compare vs ROC baseline

✅ Verify GLD is in stock universe

✅ Check regime transitions working correctly

## Technical Deep Dive: Why ATR Works

### Tomas Nesnidal's Core Principles

1. **ATR = The Holy Grail Indicator**
   - Normalizes price movements across volatility regimes
   - Makes different stocks comparable
   - Adapts to changing market conditions

2. **Point of Initiation (POI)**
   - Reference level to measure from
   - We use 100-day MA (aligns with Nick Radge's trend filter)
   - Nesnidal uses previous close (intraday futures)

3. **Space (Breakout Distance)**
   - k × ATR creates dynamic threshold
   - k = 2.0 optimal for stocks (vs 1.5-3.5 for futures)
   - Larger k = more selective = fewer but better trades

4. **Filters > Complexity**
   - Single strong filter (BSS) beats multiple weak ones
   - Keep parameters ≤ 6 (we use 3: POI period, ATR period, k)
   - Simplicity = robustness

### Adaptations from Futures to Stocks

| Aspect | Nesnidal (Futures) | Our Adaptation (Stocks) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **POI** | Yesterday's close | 100-day MA |
| **Timeframe** | 20-min bars | Daily close |
| **Direction** | Bidirectional (long/short) | Long-only |
| **Time Filter** | Intraday windows | None (daily rebalance) |
| **Exit** | USD-based stops | Rebalance-based |
| **Universe** | Single instrument (YM) | 50-stock portfolio |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Deploy BSS to paper trading**
   - Set `dry_run: true` in config
   - Monitor for minimum 1 month
   - Log all trades and allocation changes

2. **Verify GLD availability**
   - Ensure GLD is in stock universe
   - Check broker supports GLD trading
   - Confirm allocation switches working

3. **Baseline comparison**
   - Run parallel ROC strategy
   - Track performance delta
   - Document regime transitions

### Advanced Research

1. **Optimize k-multiplier:**
   - Test range: k = [1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5]
   - May vary by market regime
   - STRONG_BULL: lower k (more aggressive)
   - WEAK_BULL: higher k (more selective)

2. **Regime-specific qualifiers:**
   - STRONG_BULL: BSS (max returns)
   - WEAK_BULL: TQS or ANM (defensive)
   - BEAR: GLD 100% (as implemented)

3. **Universe size testing:**
   - Current: 50 stocks
   - Test: 20, 100, 200 stocks
   - Hypothesis: BSS works better with larger universes

4. **Alternative bear assets:**
   - GLD vs TLT vs cash vs inverse ETFs
   - GLD won in original analysis (+50% improvement)
   - Revalidate periodically
