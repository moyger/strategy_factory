## 8. Risks and Limitations

### ⚠️ Known Risks

1. **Monte Carlo Worst Case:** -63.35% (0.2% probability)
   - Mitigation: Use proper position sizing (start with 50% capital)

2. **Leverage Risk:** 1.5× leverage can amplify losses
   - Mitigation: Daily loss limit (-2%) and trailing stops

3. **Market Regime Dependency:** Relies on BTC 200MA regime filter
   - Mitigation: PAXG allocation during bear markets

4. **Rebalancing Disruption:** Annual rebalancing forces position closes
   - Mitigation: Only 37 unique cryptos, most stayed in top 20

5. **Data Quality:** Relies on Yahoo Finance data
   - Mitigation: Top 20 = best data quality

### ⚠️ Limitations

1. **Sample Size:** Only 5 years tested (includes 1 major bear, 2 bulls)
2. **Transaction Costs:** Backtest assumes constant slippage/fees
3. **Funding Rates:** Perpetual futures funding not modeled
4. **Execution Assumptions:** Assumes fills at close price

## 9. Comparison to Initial Tests

| Test | Universe | Total Return | Win Rate | Trades |
|------|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Initial (Top 10 Fixed)** | 10 cryptos | +148.88% | ~60% | 166 |
| **Top 20 Rebalanced** | **37 cryptos** | **+579.54%** | 52.5% | 240 |
| **Top 50 Rebalanced** | 101 cryptos | +153.42% | 44.3% | 316 |

**Winner:** Top 20 Rebalanced (+579.54%)

**Why?**
- 3.9× better than Top 10 (annual rebalancing critical)
- 3.8× better than Top 50 (dilution hurts performance)
- Sweet spot between coverage and quality
