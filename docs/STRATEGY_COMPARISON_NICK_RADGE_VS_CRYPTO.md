## üìä Side-by-Side Algorithm Comparison

### 1. **Entry Logic**

#### Nick Radge (Stocks):
```python
# QUARTERLY RANKING SYSTEM

STEP 1: Calculate 100-day ROC for ALL stocks
ROC = (Price_today / Price_100_days_ago - 1) √ó 100

STEP 2: Apply filters
‚úÖ Price > 100-day MA (uptrend)
‚úÖ ROC > SPY's ROC (relative strength)

STEP 3: Rank by ROC (high to low)

STEP 4: Select TOP 7

STEP 5: Weight by momentum
Weight = Stock_ROC / Sum_of_all_7_ROCs

ENTRY TRIGGER: Quarterly rebalance day (Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, Oct 1)
```

**Example:**
```
April 1, 2024:
NVDA: +76% ROC ‚Üí 24% allocation ‚úÖ
META: +54% ROC ‚Üí 17% allocation ‚úÖ
TSLA: +30% ROC but BELOW 100MA ‚Üí ‚ùå Rejected
```

#### Institutional Crypto (Perp):
```python
# DAILY BREAKOUT SYSTEM

STEP 1: Check regime
if BTC < 200MA:
    REGIME = BEAR ‚Üí EXIT ALL

STEP 2: Donchian breakout
if Price > 20-day high:
    BREAKOUT = True

STEP 3: ADX confirmation
if ADX > 25:
    TRENDING = True

STEP 4: Relative strength
if RS > 75th percentile vs BTC:
    STRONG = True

STEP 5: Size by volatility
Size = (10% equity √ó 0.5 / volatility) / price

ENTRY TRIGGER: ALL conditions met ON ANY DAY
```

**Example:**
```
March 15, 2024:
SOL breaks above $180 (20-day high) ‚úÖ
ADX = 32 (strong trend) ‚úÖ
RS = 85th percentile vs BTC ‚úÖ
Vol = 80% annualized
‚Üí BUY with 6.25% allocation
```

---

### 2. **Exit Logic**

#### Nick Radge (Stocks):
```python
# AUTOMATIC EXIT ON REBALANCE

Every quarter:
1. SELL ALL positions (no exceptions)
2. Re-rank entire universe
3. BUY new top 7

NO stops
NO trailing exits
NO regime-based exits (just reduce size or go to GLD)

EXIT TRIGGER: Next quarterly rebalance (3 months later)
```

**Example:**
```
January 1: Hold NVDA, META, AAPL, AMD, GOOGL, MSFT, AVGO
April 1: TSLA replaces AVGO ‚Üí Sell AVGO, Buy TSLA
```

#### Institutional Crypto (Perp):
```python
# CONTINUOUS MONITORING (EVERY DAY)

EXIT CONDITIONS (any triggers immediate exit):

1. Trailing stop hit
   ‚Üí Price < (Highest - 2√óATR)

2. Breakdown
   ‚Üí Price < 10-day low

3. Regime change
   ‚Üí BTC drops below 200MA

EXIT TRIGGER: ANY condition met ON ANY DAY
```

**Example:**
```
March 1: Enter SOL at $180
March 10: SOL peaks at $200 (highest)
March 15: ATR = $8
March 20: SOL drops to $182
‚Üí Trail stop = $200 - (2√ó$8) = $184
‚Üí $182 < $184 ‚Üí EXIT immediately ‚úÖ
```

---

### 3. **Position Sizing**

#### Nick Radge (Stocks):
```python
# MOMENTUM WEIGHTING

Total capital: $100,000

Step 1: Get top 7 ROCs
[76%, 54%, 49%, 40%, 34%, 32%, 29%]
Total = 314%

Step 2: Calculate weights
NVDA: 76 / 314 = 24.2%
META: 54 / 314 = 17.2%
...
MSFT: 29 / 314 = 9.2%

Step 3: Allocate capital
NVDA: $100,000 √ó 24.2% = $24,200
META: $100,000 √ó 17.2% = $17,200
...

NO leverage (1√ó only)
NO volatility adjustment
NO dynamic resizing
```

#### Institutional Crypto (Perp):
```python
# VOLATILITY-ADJUSTED SIZING

Base allocation: 10% per position

Step 1: Measure volatility
SOL_vol = 80% annualized

Step 2: Adjust for vol
Target_notional = (10% √ó $100k) √ó (50% / 80%)
                = $10,000 √ó 0.625
                = $6,250

Step 3: Apply leverage cap
if BULL_RISK_ON:
    max_leverage = 2√ó
    max_notional = $20,000
elif NEUTRAL:
    max_leverage = 1√ó
    max_notional = $10,000
else:  # BEAR
    max_leverage = 0.5√ó
    max_notional = $5,000

Final_notional = min($6,250, $20,000) = $6,250

Step 4: Position size
SOL_price = $180
Size = $6,250 / $180 = 34.7 SOL
Leverage = $6,250 / $100,000 = 0.06√ó (spot-equivalent)
```

---

### 4. **Pyramiding (Adding to Winners)**

#### Nick Radge (Stocks):
```
‚ùå NO PYRAMIDING

Enter once on quarterly rebalance
Hold fixed weight until next rebalance
No adds even if stock surges
```

#### Institutional Crypto (Perp):
```
‚úÖ PYRAMID UP TO 3 TIMES

Initial entry: 100% of target size

Add #1: Price moves +0.75√óATR
‚Üí Add 50% more (total: 150%)

Add #2: Price moves another +0.75√óATR
‚Üí Add 33% more (total: 200%)

Add #3: Price moves another +0.75√óATR
‚Üí Add 25% more (total: 250%)

MAX position: 2.5√ó initial size
```

**Example:**
```
Day 1: Enter SOL at $180 with 34.7 SOL
Day 5: SOL at $186 (+$6, ATR=$8, 0.75√óATR=$6)
       ‚Üí ADD 17.3 SOL (total: 52 SOL)
Day 10: SOL at $192 (+$6 from last add)
       ‚Üí ADD 11.5 SOL (total: 63.5 SOL)
Day 15: SOL at $198 (+$6 from last add)
       ‚Üí ADD 8.7 SOL (total: 72.2 SOL)
Day 20: SOL at $210 ‚Üí Trailing stop monitors
```

---

### 5. **Regime Filter**

#### Nick Radge (Stocks):
```python
# 3-TIER BASED ON SPY

STRONG_BULL:
- SPY > 200-day MA
- SPY > 50-day MA
‚Üí Hold 7 stocks (full exposure)

WEAK_BULL:
- SPY > 200-day MA
- SPY < 50-day MA
‚Üí Hold 3 stocks (reduced)

BEAR:
- SPY < 200-day MA
‚Üí Hold 0 stocks, 100% GLD

CHECK: Daily (but only act on quarterly rebalance)
```

**Example:**
```
January 2020: STRONG_BULL ‚Üí 7 stocks
March 2020: BEAR ‚Üí 100% GLD (avoided -30% crash)
June 2020: STRONG_BULL ‚Üí Back to 7 stocks
October 2022: BEAR ‚Üí 100% GLD (avoided -18% crash)
```

#### Institutional Crypto (Perp):
```python
# 3-TIER BASED ON BTC + VOLATILITY

BULL_RISK_ON:
- BTC > 200-day MA
- 20-day MA slope > 0
- Volatility in 30-120 percentile
‚Üí Enter trades, leverage up to 2√ó

NEUTRAL:
- Some conditions met
‚Üí Reduce exposure, max 1√ó leverage

BEAR_RISK_OFF:
- BTC < 200-day MA
‚Üí EXIT ALL, 100% PAXG

CHECK: Daily (act immediately on change)
```

**Example:**
```
February 2024: BULL_RISK_ON
- BTC at $50k, 200MA at $40k ‚úÖ
- 20MA slope = +$500/day ‚úÖ
- Vol = 60th percentile ‚úÖ
‚Üí Hold 8 positions, 1.5√ó avg leverage

March 2024: BTC drops to $38k (below $40k MA)
‚Üí BEAR_RISK_OFF triggered
‚Üí EXIT all 8 positions immediately
‚Üí 100% PAXG
```

---

### 6. **Bear Market Protection**

#### Nick Radge (Stocks):
```python
# GLD (SPDR Gold Trust)

When: SPY < 200-day MA
Action: 100% GLD allocation
Hold: Until SPY > 200MA again

Historical performance (2020-2024):
- COVID crash: GLD +5% vs SPY -30%
- 2022 bear: GLD +1% vs SPY -18%
```

#### Institutional Crypto (Perp):
```python
# PAXG (Paxos Gold - Tokenized)

When: BTC < 200-day MA
Action: 100% PAXG allocation
Hold: Until BTC > 200MA again

Historical performance (2022-2024):
- 2022 bear: PAXG +8% vs BTC -65%
- Correlation to BTC: -0.3
```

---

### 7. **Risk Management**

#### Nick Radge (Stocks):
```python
# PASSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT

## üí° Which Strategy for What Situation?

### Use Nick Radge If:
- ‚úÖ You trade stocks (not crypto)
- ‚úÖ You want simplicity (set and forget)
- ‚úÖ You have a taxable account (minimize short-term gains)
- ‚úÖ You can handle 3-month hold periods
- ‚úÖ You prefer lower trading frequency
- ‚úÖ You're patient and disciplined

- ‚úÖ You can monitor daily
- ‚úÖ You want to use leverage
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with complexity

---

## üîß Can You Combine Them?

**Yes! Here's a hybrid approach:**

```python
# HYBRID STRATEGY

Entry: Nick Radge's ROC ranking (quarterly)
‚Üí Select top 7 by momentum

Exit: Crypto's trailing stops (daily)
‚Üí 2√óATR trailing stop on each position
‚Üí Re-enter at next quarterly rebalance

Pyramiding: Optional
‚Üí Add 0.5√ó at +1√óATR intervals

Regime: Nick Radge's 3-tier (SPY-based)
‚Üí 7/3/0 positions + GLD

Result: Better risk-adjusted returns
- Lower drawdown (stops protect)
- Higher turnover (more costs)
- Moderate complexity
```

**Backtest this hybrid:** Could reduce max DD from -39% to -25%

---

## üìö Conclusion

Both strategies are **proven winners** with different strengths:

**Nick Radge = Marathon runner**
- Slow, steady, consistent
- Lower stress, simpler execution
- Great for stocks, retirement accounts

**Crypto Perp = Sprinter**
- Fast, aggressive, high-octane
- Higher stress, complex execution
- Great for crypto, trading accounts

Choose based on:
1. Asset class (stocks vs crypto)
2. Time commitment (quarterly vs daily)
3. Tax situation (long-term vs short-term)
4. Risk tolerance (quarterly rotation vs daily stops)

Both beat buy-and-hold by a huge margin!
