## üé≤ Position Sizing

```python
# Fixed fractional (0.5% risk)
risk_amount = account_equity √ó 0.005
shares = risk_amount / (stop_loss - entry_price)

# Max position value = 10% of account
max_shares = (account_equity √ó 0.10) / entry_price
shares = min(shares, max_shares)
```

**Example:**
- Account: $100,000
- Risk: $500 (0.5%)
- Entry: $50, Stop: $52
- Risk/share: $2
- Shares: 500 / 2 = **250 shares**

---

## üìä Exit Strategy (Scale Out)

```
Position: 300 shares

R2 (2√ó risk):   Sell 100 shares (1/3)
R1 (1√ó risk):   Sell 100 shares (1/3)
VWAP (runner):  Sell 100 shares (1/3)

Hard Stop: Entry stop loss (close all)
EOD Exit: 3:55 PM (close all remaining)
```

**Example:**
- Entry: $50, Stop: $52, Risk: $2
- R1: $48 (1√ó risk = $2 profit)
- R2: $46 (2√ó risk = $4 profit)
- VWAP: $45 (dynamic, trail to VWAP)

## üíª Quick Code Snippets

### Load Data
```python
from data.alpaca_data_loader import AlpacaDataLoader

loader = AlpacaDataLoader(api_key='...', secret_key='...', paper=True)
bars = loader.get_1min_bars('GME', '2021-01-28', '2021-01-28')
```

### Scan for Signals
```python
from indicators.intraday_indicators import calculate_all_indicators
from strategies.temiz_small_cap_short_strategy import TemizSmallCapShortStrategy

indicators = calculate_all_indicators(bars)
strategy = TemizSmallCapShortStrategy()
signals = strategy.scan_for_signals(bars, indicators)
```

### Check Quality
```python
from indicators.confluence_filters import ConfluenceFilters

filters = ConfluenceFilters(alpaca_api_key='...', alpaca_secret_key='...')
result = filters.get_composite_score(
    symbol='GME',
    current_volume=50_000_000,
    avg_volume_20d=10_000_000,
    float_shares=50_000_000
)

if result['composite_score'] >= 70:
    # STRONG SHORT - take trade
```

### Run Backtest
```python
from examples.backtest_temiz_strategy import TemizBacktester

backtester = TemizBacktester(initial_capital=100000)
results = backtester.backtest_single_day('GME', bars, strategy, verbose=True)
backtester.print_results()
```
